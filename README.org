* Firefox Proton Square
[[https://github.com/leadweedy/Firefox-Proton-Square/blob/main/ff_protonbutquantum.png]]
  If you are like me and hate rounded tabs, this is for you.

  Overall I understand why Mozilla went the direction they did with [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Proton][Proton]] to "modernize" the UI, but not to say that I have to like it.
  
  These tweaks attempt to recreate the feel of Quantum with its squared tabs and menus, but in the Proton UI.

  - *Tab Design*
    - General:
      - Connect with toolbar(Buttons like tabs)
      - Square corners
    - Selected:
      - Add colored tab context line above selected tab
    - Unselected:
      - Divide Line: full height and colored like Quantum
      - Remove white space between tabs
  - *Menu Design*
    - General:
      - Square corners on most popup menus
