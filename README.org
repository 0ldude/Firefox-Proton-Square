Tested on Stable and Beta channels (Firefox 91+)

  If you are like me and hate rounded tabs, this is for you.

  Overall I understand why Mozilla went the direction they did with [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Proton][Proton]] to "modernize" the UI, but not to say that I have to like it.
  
  These tweaks attempt to recreate the feel of Quantum with its squared tabs and menus, but in the Proton UI. As of FF91, the about:config option to disable proton ("browser.proton.enabled = false") has been deprecated, leaving CSS as the main way to revert the UI.

  - *Tab Design*
    - General:
      - Connect with toolbar(Buttons like tabs)
      - Square corners
      - No spacer on left tab bar when windowed
    - Selected:
      - Add colored tab context line above selected tab
    - Unselected:
      - Divide Line: full height and colored like Quantum
      - Remove white space between tabs
  - *Menu Design*
    - General:
      - Square corners on most popup menus

** Suggested Tweaks (about:config)
  - set =browser.tabs.tabMinWidth= to =150= px or desired width
  - set =widget.non-native-theme.gtk.scrollbar.round-thumb= to =false= to square the scrollbar (linux only)
  - change =layout.css.devPixelsPerPx= to scale the whole browser (1.0 represents 100% scaling)
